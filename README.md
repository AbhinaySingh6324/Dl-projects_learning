# Dl-projects_learning
dl project learning  with practice is efficient.
Implemented Ann and cnn on every data set.
Dl model is self explanatory regardless of the input and output layers every layer is trail and error, You can learn about he stateof the art model for every dataset for the best accuracy till now.
Underlying maths is busted and advanced techniques are implemented using apis from tensorflow.
Much more comming to the list 
Stay Tuned;)....
