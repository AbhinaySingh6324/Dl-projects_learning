These marix will be learned on training and during inference each word will be mapped to corresponding 512 d vector. Suppose we have batch size of 32 and sequence length of 10(10 words).

Inorder for the model to make \nsense of the sentence, it needs to know two things about the each word.\n* what does the word mean?\n* what is the position of the word in the sentence.\n\nIn \"attention is all you need paper\" author used the following functions to create positional encoding. On odd time steps a cosine function is used and in even time steps a sine function is used.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/524/1*yWGV9ck-0ltfV2wscUeo7Q.png\">\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/564/1*SgNlyFaHH8ljBbpCupDhSQ.png\">\n\n```\npos -> refers to order in the sentence\ni -> refers to position along embedding vector dimension\n```\n\nPositinal embedding will generate a matrix of similar to embedding matrix. It will create a matrix of dimension sequence length x embedding dimension. For each token(word) in sequence, we will find the embedding vector which is of dimension 1 x 512 and it is added with the correspondng positional vector which is of dimension 1 x 512 to get 1 x 512 dim out for each word/token.\n\nfor eg: if we have batch size of 32 and seq length of 10 and let embedding dimension be 512. Then we will have embedding vector of dimension 32 x 10 x 512. Similarly we will have positional encoding vector of dimension 32 x 10 x 512.

It's easy to understand for the humans that it is Dog. But not for the machines.\n\nAs model proceeses each word, self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues. It will creates a vector based on dependency of each word with the other.\n\n\nLet us go through a step by step illustration of self attention.\n\n* **Step 1:** The first step in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoderâ€™s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. Each of the vector will be of dimension 1x64.\n\nSince we have a multihead attention we will have 8 self attention heads.I will explain the code with 8 attention head in mind.\n\n**How key,queries and values can be created?**\n\nWe will have a key matrix,query matrix and a value matrix to generate key, query and value.\nThese matrixes are learned during training.\n\n```\ncode hint:\nSuppose we have batch_size=32,sequence_length=10, embedding dimension=512. So after embedding and positional encoding our output will be of dimension 32x10x512.\nWe will resize it to 32x10x8x16.(About 8, it is the number of heads in multihead attention.Dont worry you will get to know about it once you go through the code.).\n\n```\n\n\n* **Step 2:**  Second step is to calculate the score. ie, we will multiply query marix with key matrix. [Q x K.t]\n\n```\ncode hint:\nSuppose our key,query and value dimension be 32x10x8x64. Before proceeding further, we will transpose each of them for multiplication convinience (32x8x10x64). Now multiply query matrix with transpose key matrix. ie (32x8x10x64) x (32x8x64x10) -> (32x8x10x10).\n```\n\n\n* **Step 3:** Now divide the output matrix with dimension of key matrix and then apply Softmax over it.\n\n\n* **Step 4:** Then this gets multiply it with value matrix.\n\n```\ncode hint:\nAfter step 3 our output will be of dimension 32x8x10x10. Now muliply it with value matrix (32x8x10x64) to get output of dimension (32x8x10x64).Here 8 is the number of attention heads and 10 is the sequence length.Thus for each word we have 64 dim vector.\n```\n\n* **Step 5:** Once we have this we will pass this through a linear layer. This forms the output of multihead attention.\n\n```\ncode hint:\n(32x8x10x64) vector gets transposed to (32x10x8x64) and then reshaped as (32x10x512).Then it is passed through a linear layer to get output of (32x10x512).\n```\n\n\nNow you got an idea on how multihead attention works.

We will use the output of encoder to generate key and query vectors for the decoder.There are two kinds of multi head attention in the decoder.One is the decoder attention and other is the encoder decoder attention. Don't worry we will go step by step.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let us explain with respect to the training phase. Firt\n\n**Step 1:**\n\nFirst the output  gets passed through the embeddin and positional encoding to create a embedding vector of dimension 1x512 corresponding to each word in the target sequence.\n\n```\ncode hint\nSuppose we have a sequence length of 10. batch size of 32 and embedding vector dimension of 512. we have input of size 32x10 to the embedding matrix which produces and output of dimension 32x10x512 which gets added with the positional encoding of same dimension and produces a 32x10x512 out\n\n```\n\n**Step 2:**\n\nThe embeddig output gets passed through a multihead attention layers as before(creating key,query and value matrixes from the target input) and produces an output vector. This tame the major difference is that we uses a mask with multihead attention. \n\n**Why mask?**\n\nMask is used because while creating attention of target words, we donot need a word to look in to the future words to check the dependency. ie, we already learned that why we create attention because we need to know contribution of each word with the other word. Since we are creating attention for words in target sequnce, we donot need a particular word to see the future words. For eg: in word \"I am a strudent\", we donot need the word \"a\" to look word \"student\".\n\n\n```\ncode hint\nFor creating attention we created a triangular matrix with 1 and 0.eg:traingular matrix for seq length 5 looks as below:\n\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nAfter the key gets multiplied with query, we fill all zero positions with negative inifinity, In code we will fill it with a very small number to avoid division errors.\n(with -1e 20)\n\n\n```\n\n**Step 3:**\n\nAs before we have a add and norm layer where we add with output of embedding with attention out and normalized it.\n\n\n**Step 4:**\n\n\nNext we have another multihead attention and then a add and norm layer. This multihead attention is called encoder-decorder multihead attention. For this multihead attention we create we create key and query vectors from the encoder output. Value is created from the output of previous decoder layer.\n\n```\ncode hint:\nThus we have 32x10x512 out from encoder out. key and query for all words are generated from it. Similary value matrix is generated from otput from previous layer of decoder(32x10x512).\n\n```\n\nThus it is passed through a multihead atention (we used number of heads = 8) the through a Add and Norm layer. Here the output from previous encoder layer(ie previoud add and norm layer) gets added with encoder-decoder attention output and then normalized.\n\n**Step 5:**\nNext we have a feed forward layer(linear layer) with add and nom which is similar to that of present in the encoder.\n\n\n**Step 6:**\nFinally we create a linear layer with length equal to number of words in total target corpus and a softmax function with it to get probablity of each word.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class DecoderBlock(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, expansion_factor=4,
